# Deadliest-Warrior

The classic card game War... With a twist. Player's decks are not composed of standardized 2-A cards, but of the greatest warriors throughout history. Random warrior cards from a player's hand are pitted againt the computer's warrior card and the winner leaves with the captive added to their growing army(deck). Last army standing wins!!!
